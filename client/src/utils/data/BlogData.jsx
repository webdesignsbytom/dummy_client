Because I was too busy picking myself apart. Iâ€™d convince myself my angles werenâ€™t flattering enough, that I didnâ€™t look as snatched as the girls with modified bodies, that something was just off. And now, when I look back at those videos? They were beautiful. I was beautiful. And I should have posted them. But I was too caught up in my own insecurities, being my own worst critic.",

To compare myself to bodies that arenâ€™t even real? My body is real. My body is mine. And instead of picking it apart, Iâ€™ve had to teach myself to embrace it. To show up in my fullness without overanalyzing every single inch. Because if I donâ€™t, Iâ€™ll keep robbing myself of seeing how beautiful I already am.",

          'Own Your Desires Without Shame - Society has spent way too long trying to make women feel ashamed of their sexuality. But hereâ€™s the truth: you donâ€™t need permission to enjoy your own pleasure.

          'Step Into the Roleâ€”Even Before You Feel Ready - Confidence doesnâ€™t come from waiting until you feel confident. It comes from doing. You become more comfortable by stepping into the energy you want to embody. So dress the part, talk the part, and most importantlyâ€”believe the part.',

          'Set Boundaries and Expect Them to Be Respected - Being confident isnâ€™t just about how you carry yourselfâ€”itâ€™s about what you allow and donâ€™t allow.

          'Practice Saying What You Wantâ€”Out Loud - Whether itâ€™s to a partner, a lover, or yourself in the mirror, get used to vocalizing your desires.
